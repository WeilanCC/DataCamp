# DataCamp

The goal of Data Camp is to compete in Kaggle-like competition in order to find the best model for prediction tasks using machine learning techniques. In addition to classical formula, here not only the predicitions are evaluated but also model is trained on the site's server (submissions include the code).

There are two phases: individual and collaborative. In the first one, every competitor (student) works on its own. After the end of this phase all the submissions are published, teams are created and everyone can openly reuse the code of others, provided that it is credited.

This repository serves the code of the group submission of
 * Pawe≈Ç Guzewicz
 * Hamza Kasry
 * Miaobing Chen
 * Anderson Carlos Ferreira da Silva
